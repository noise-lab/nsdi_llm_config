\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced \sysname{}, a framework for router misconfiguration detection that leverages context-aware iterative prompting to improve the accuracy of LLMs. By systematically extracting relevant context from network configurations
and following a guided, interactive prompting mechanism, \sysname{} addresses limitations in current model checkers, data mining tools, and LLM-based models. Through case studies involving both synthetic and real-world misconfigurations, we demonstrated that \sysname{} outperforms existing methods across different misconfiguration types, ensuring more reliable and scalable network configuration verification.
