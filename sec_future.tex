\sysname{} has proven effective in improving the detection of router misconfigurations, but there are several avenues for further exploration and refinement. One challenge is expanding the framework to better handle large-scale, distributed networks with interdependent routers. These environments often involve complex relationships between devices, and future work could focus on extending \sysname{} to capture and analyze multi-device contexts by default. Incorporating cross-router consistency checks and advanced network-wide policy validation could be valuable enhancements.

Another area for improvement is enhancing the LLM's ability to process real-time configuration changes. As networks evolve dynamically, incorporating real-time monitoring data into the context mining process would allow for continuous verification and faster misconfiguration detection. Integrating \sysname{} with network management tools that track operational metrics could provide valuable runtime data, further improving detection accuracy by correlating live data with configuration snapshots.

Future enhancements can also involve proposing and implementing automated fixes for detected misconfigurations with real-time updates. This would help network operators quickly address issues, streamlining troubleshooting and repairs.
